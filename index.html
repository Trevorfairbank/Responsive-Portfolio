      <p>Hello there, my name is Trevor Fairbank. I was born and raised in Zephyr Cove, Nevada (Lake Tahoe). I attended San Diego State University and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Multimedia and a minor in Business Marketing in 2016. ​After college, I worked as a freelance photographer shooting product and food imagery for a few small businesses.</p>

      <p>I realized that I do not want to lose my passion for photography by being overworked, so I began to learn how to code. I am currently taking a three month course at UCSD to learn how to be a full stack web developer and it is going great!</p>

      <p>I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and working with computers, so once I can speak and write in some web languages, I know I'll be able to keep my passion for photography and work as a web developer.</p>
